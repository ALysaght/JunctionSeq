<section><pre><code>&gt; v0.99.6 (Revised Mon Jan 11 11:24:24 EST 2016)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/">JunctionSeq</a> is an R package for detection and visualization of differential usage of
exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets.
The methodology is heavily based on the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a>
bioconductor package, originally proposed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343">Anders, Reyes, and Huber</a>. More information
is available on the <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/">JunctionSeq GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>The core advantage of JunctionSeq over other similar tools is that it provides a powerful automated tools for
generating readable and interpretable plots and tables to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
An example results report is available <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/exampleResults/testForDU.html">here</a>.
An example set of browser tracks from this same dataset is available
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&amp;hgS_otherUserName=stephen.hartley&amp;hgS_otherUserSessionName=rn6_pipelineWalkthrough_finalTracks">here</a>, which uses <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/trackHub/index.html">this trackhub</a>.</p>

<p>Issues, bug reports, or feature requests can be posted to the
<a href="https://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq/issues">github issues page</a>.
The developers can be contacted at JunctionSeq-Contact (at) list.nih.gov.</p>

<p>Note: the current version of JunctionSeq is ONLY compatible with Bioconductor 3.2 or higher.
For older versions of JunctionSeq compatible with Bioconductor 3.0 and 3.1, see JunctionSeq release v0.5.1.</p>

<p><b><i>JunctionSeq has been pre-accepted into <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>, and will probably be included in the next Bioconductor release.</b></i>
Even after JunctionSeq is added to Bioconductor we will continue to update and maintain this page, as these pages provide
additional online help and documentation.</p>

<p>Note: <em>The example dataset and results are for testing and demonstration purposes only.</em> The samples and annotation have been heavily modified and down-sampled
both to test artificial edge cases and to provide smaller and more portable testing files.
The results should not be taken as an indication of any biological phenomenon.</p>

</section> <h2>INSTALLATION:</h2> <section>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed automatically in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JS.install.R");
&gt; JS.install();
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for advanced installation options.</p>

<p>The splice, gene, and exon read-counts required by JunctionSeq can be created
using the QoRTs software package, available <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/index.html">here</a>.</p>

</section> <h2>EXAMPLE DATA:</h2> <section>

<p>Another example dataset, used in the vignette, is packaged as an R package, and can be installed with the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JctSeqData_LATEST.tar.gz",
                  repos = NULL,
                  type="source")
