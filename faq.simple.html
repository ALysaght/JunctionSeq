<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>JunctionSeq is an R package designed to detect and assess 
differential usage of exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is based on the methods used by the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a> 
bioconductor package, originally proposed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343">Anders, Reyes, and Huber</a>.</p>

<p>Help, documentation, and the most recent release of JunctionSeq is available on the 
<a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/index.html">JunctionSeq github pages</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not find an answer to your question here, you can email the developer at JunctionSeq-Contact (at) list.nih.gov.</p>

<p>Note: the current version of JunctionSeq is ONLY compatible with Bioconductor 3.2 or higher.
For older versions of JunctionSeq compatible with Bioconductor 3.0 and 3.1, see JunctionSeq release v0.5.1.</p>

<h2>HELP AND DOCUMENTATION:</h2>

<p>For more information see the <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/doc/JunctionSeq.pdf">JunctionSeq vignette</a> or the 
<a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/Rhtml/index.html">online reference documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/doc/example-walkthrough.pdf">comprehensive walkthrough</a> of 
the entire analysis pipeline, along with a full 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/QoRTsPipelineWalkthrough.zip">example dataset</a> with

<h2>HOW DO I CITE JUNCTIONSEQ?</h2>

<p>You can currently cite the JunctionSeq methodology preprint paper as:</p>

<p>Hartley SW, Mullikin JC. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06038">Detection and Visualization of Differential Exon and Splice Junction Usage in RNA-Seq Data with JunctionSeq.</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> preprint <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06038">arXiv:1512.06038</a>. 2015 Dec 18.</p>

<h2>BASIC INSTALLATION (from source):</h2>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed automatically from source using the R commands:</p>

<pre><code>source("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JS.install.R");
JS.install();
</code></pre>

<h2>MANUAL INSTALLATION:</h2>

<p>If you encounter problems with installation, you can install all prerequisite packages manually using the R commands:</p>

<pre><code>#Install CRAN packages:
install.packages("statmod")
install.packages("plotrix")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("Hmisc")
install.packages("locfit")
#Install Bioconductor packages:
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
biocLite();
biocLite("Biobase");
biocLite("BiocGenerics");
biocLite("BiocParallel");
biocLite("GenomicRanges");
biocLite("IRanges");
biocLite("S4Vectors");
biocLite("genefilter");
biocLite("geneplotter");
biocLite("SummarizedExperiment");
biocLite("DESeq2");
</code></pre>

<p>You can then install JunctionSeq itself with the command:</p>

<pre><code>#Install JunctionSeq (from source):
install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JunctionSeq_LATEST.tar.gz", 
                   repos = NULL, 
                   type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>JunctionSeq NO LONGER REQUIRES COMPILATION. Thus, Rtools and XCode toolsets are no longer necessary to install JunctionSeq.</p>

<h2>Reducing Memory Usage:</h2>

<p>JunctionSeq may use large amounts of RAM. You can reduce the memory usage considerably by reducing the number of cores used with the nCores parameter. 
Unfortunetely, BiocParallel duplicates the entire environment whenever it runs in multicore mode, so amount of RAM required is multiplied by the number of cores in 
use.</p>

<p>The exact memory requirements will vary depending on a large number of different factors, such as genome size/complexity, number of replicates, and the number of novel splice junctions.</p>
