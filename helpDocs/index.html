<h1>JunctionSeq: Detection of Differential Splice Junction Usage in RNA-Seq Data</h1>

<p>v0.3.5
Revised Thu Apr 23 16:47:45 EDT 2015</p>

<p>JunctionSeq is an R package designed to detect and assess 
differential splice junction usage in High-Throughput, 
Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is similar to the methods used by the DEXSeq 
bioconductor package.</p>

<p>The most recent release of JunctionSeq is available on the 
<a href="http://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq">JunctionSeq github page</a>.
Additional help and documentation can be found 
<a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/JunctionSeq/helpDocs/index.html">here</a>.
Issues, bug reports, or feature requests can be posted to the 
<a href="https://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq/issues">github issues page</a>.</p>

<h2>HELP AND DOCUMENTATION:</h2>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="doc/JunctionSeq.pdf">JunctionSeq vignette</a> or the 
<a href="Rhtml/index.html">online reference documentation</a> (or as a <a href="doc/JunctionSeq-reference.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>

<p>Help is also available from within R, accessed via the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(functionname);
</code></pre>

<p>For a full listing of all help topics, use the R 
command: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(package="JunctionSeq");
</code></pre>

<h2>INSTALLATION:</h2>

<p>JunctionSeq is dependent on a number of other R packages. These 
dependencies can be installed using the R commands:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("statmod")
&gt; install.packages("plotrix")
&gt; install.packages("stringr")
&gt; source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
&gt; biocLite()
&gt; biocLite("Biobase")
</code></pre>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("JunctionSeq_0.3.5.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>The splice-junction counts required by JunctionSeq can be created 
using the QoRTs software package, available 
<a href="http://github.com/hartleys/QoRTs">here</a>.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE DATA:</h2>

<p>The example dataset can be found on the github main page, and can be
installed with the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages(JctSeqExData_0.3.5.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
</code></pre>
