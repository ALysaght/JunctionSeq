</code></pre>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>JunctionSeq is an R package designed to detect and assess 
differential usage of exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is based on the methods used by the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a> 
bioconductor package, originally proposed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343">Anders, Reyes, and Huber</a>.</p>

<p>Help, documentation, and the most recent release of JunctionSeq is available on the 
<a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/index.html">JunctionSeq github pages</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not find an answer to your question here, you can email the developer at JunctionSeq-Contact (at) list.nih.gov.</p>

<p>Note: the current version of JunctionSeq is ONLY compatible with Bioconductor 3.2 or higher.
For older versions of JunctionSeq compatible with Bioconductor 3.0 and 3.1, see JunctionSeq release v0.5.1.</p>

</section> <h2>HELP AND DOCUMENTATION:</h2> <section>

<p>For more information see the <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/doc/JunctionSeq.pdf">JunctionSeq vignette</a> or the 
<a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/Rhtml/index.html">online reference documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/doc/example-walkthrough.pdf">comprehensive walkthrough</a> of 
the entire analysis pipeline, along with a full 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/QoRTsPipelineWalkthrough.zip">example dataset</a> with 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/bamfiles.zip">example bam files</a>.</p>

<p>For help with individual R functions in the R utility, use the R 
command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(functionname);
</code></pre>

<p>For a full listing of all help topics for the R utility, use the R 
command: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(package="JunctionSeq");
</code></pre>

</section> <h2>BASIC INSTALLATION:</h2> <section>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed automatically in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JS.install.R");
&gt; JS.install();
</code></pre>

<p>In order to successfully install from source on windows, you must have <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a> installed.</p>

</section> <h2>MANUAL INSTALLATION:</h2> <section>

<p>If you encounter problems with installation, you can install manually using the R commands:</p>

<pre><code>#Install CRAN packages:
install.packages("statmod")
install.packages("plotrix")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("RcppArmadillo")
install.packages("locfit")
#Install Bioconductor packages:
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");
biocLite();
biocLite("Biobase");
biocLite("BiocGenerics");
biocLite("BiocParallel");
biocLite("GenomicRanges");
biocLite("IRanges");
biocLite("S4Vectors");
biocLite("genefilter");
biocLite("geneplotter");
biocLite("SummarizedExperiment");
#Install JunctionSeq:
install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JunctionSeq_LATEST.tar.gz", 
                   repos = NULL, 
                   type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>If you are installing to windows, you will also require <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a> 
which allows advanced packages to be installed from source-code.</p>

</section> <h2>Reducing Memory Usage:</h2> <section>

<p>JunctionSeq may use large amounts of RAM. You can reduce the memory usage considerably by reducing the number of cores used with the nCores parameter. 
Unfortunetely, BiocParallel duplicates the entire environment whenever it runs in multicore mode, so amount of RAM required is multiplied by the number of cores in 
use.</p>

<p>The exact memory requirements will vary depending on a large number of different factors, such as genome size/complexity, number of replicates, and the number of novel splice junctions.</p>
