<section><pre><code>&gt; v1.3.4 (Revised Wed May 18 17:03:38 EDT 2016)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/">JunctionSeq</a> is a <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> package for detection and visualization of differential usage of 
exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is heavily based on the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a> 
bioconductor package, originally proposed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343">Anders, Reyes, and Huber</a>.</p>

<p>One major advantage of JunctionSeq over other similar tools is that it provides a powerful automated tools for
generating readable and interpretable plots and tables to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
An example results report is available <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/exampleResults/testForDU.html">here</a>. 
An example set of browser tracks from this same dataset is available 
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&amp;hgS_otherUserName=stephen.hartley&amp;hgS_otherUserSessionName=rn6_pipelineWalkthrough_finalTracks">here</a>, which uses <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/trackHub/index.html">this trackhub</a>.</p>

<p>Issues, bug reports, or feature requests can be posted to the 
<a href="https://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq/issues">github issues page</a>.
The developers can be contacted at JunctionSeq-Contact (at) list.nih.gov.</p>

<p><strong>JunctionSeq is now part of <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>, and will be included in the next release (3.3).</strong> 
You can install JunctionSeq using the devel branch of Bioconductor at the <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/JunctionSeq/">JunctionSeq bioconductor page</a>. Alternatively, you 
can use the installation instructions below to install the most recent version of JunctionSeq onto the current Bioconductor release (3.2).</p>

<p>Note: <em>The example dataset and results are for testing and demonstration purposes only.</em> The samples and annotation have been heavily modified and down-sampled 
both to test artificial edge cases and to provide smaller and more portable testing files. 
The results should not be taken as an indication of any biological phenomenon.</p>

</section> <h2>CITING JUNCTIONSEQ:</h2> <section>

<p>You can cite the JunctionSeq methods paper, now published in Nucleic Acids Research:</p>

<p>Hartley SW, Mullikin JC. <a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/07/nar.gkw501.full">Detection and visualization of differential splicing in RNA-Seq data with JunctionSeq</a>. 
<a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/">Nucleic Acids Research</a>. 2016 Jun 1. pii: gkw501. doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw501">10.1093/nar/gkw501</a>. PubMed PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257077">27257077</a>.</p>

</section> <h2>INSTALLATION:</h2> <section>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed automatically in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>source("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JS.install.R");
JS.install();
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for advanced installation options.</p>

<p>The splice, gene, and exon read-counts required by JunctionSeq can be created 
using the QoRTs software package, available <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/index.html">here</a>.</p>

</section> <h2>BIOCONDUCTOR INSTALLATION:</h2> <section>

<p>If you are using the newest bioconductor release (v3.3), then you can install the <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/JunctionSeq/">Bioconductor version of JunctionSeq</a>:</p>

<pre><code>source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("JunctionSeq")
</code></pre>

<p>The bioconductor version differs from the GitHub version in that the post-release patches to 
a given bioconductor release will never add new features (although bugfixes may be added). This is 
intended to maintain replicability, but also means that the Bioconductor version will lag behind the github version.</p>

<p>In addition, the GitHub version is currently compatible with R versions 3.2 and 3.3, whereas the Bioconductor version requires v3.3.</p>

<p>Note that unless the "major" version number changes (ie, v2.0.0+), all future versions of JunctionSeq (here or on Bioconductor) will ALWAYS 
maintain full backwards-compatible functionality with all versions 1.0.0 and up.</p>

</section> <h2>EXAMPLE DATA:</h2> <section>

<p>Another example dataset, used in the vignette, is packaged as an R package, and can be installed with the command:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JctSeqData_LATEST.tar.gz", 
                  repos = NULL, 
                  type="source")
</code></pre>
