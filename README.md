    > v0.6.9 (Revised Wed Nov 18 17:48:22 EST 2015)

[JunctionSeq](http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/) is an R package designed to detect and assess 
differential usage of exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is based on the methods used by the [DEXSeq](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html) 
bioconductor package, originally proposed by [Anders, Reyes, and Huber](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343). Help, documentation, 
and the most recent release of JunctionSeq is available on the [JunctionSeq github page](http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/).

Issues, bug reports, or feature requests can be posted to the 
[github issues page](https://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq/issues).
The developers can be contacted at JunctionSeq-Contact (at) list.nih.gov.

Note: the current version of JunctionSeq is ONLY compatible with Bioconductor 3.2 or higher.
For older versions of JunctionSeq compatible with Bioconductor 3.0 and 3.1, see JunctionSeq release v0.5.1.
