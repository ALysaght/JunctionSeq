<p>JunctionSeq is an R package designed to detect and assess 
differential usage of exons and splice junctions in High-Throughput, Next-Generation RNA-Seq datasets. 
The methodology is based on the methods used by the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html">DEXSeq</a> 
bioconductor package, originally proposed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722343">Anders, Reyes, and Huber</a>.</p>

<p>Help, documentation, and the most recent release of JunctionSeq is available on the 
<a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/index.html">JunctionSeq github pages</a>.</p>

<p><strong>JunctionSeq is currently in an early alpha stage, and is not yet intended for general use.</strong></p>

<p>Issues, bug reports, or feature requests can be posted to the 
<a href="https://github.com/hartleys/JunctionSeq/issues">github issues page</a>.</p>

<h2>HELP AND DOCUMENTATION:</h2>

<p>For more information see the <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/helpDocs/doc/JunctionSeq.pdf">JunctionSeq vignette</a> or the 
<a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/JunctionSeq/helpDocs/Rhtml/index.html">online reference documentation</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/helpDocs/doc/example-walkthrough.pdf">comprehensive walkthrough</a> of 
the entire analysis pipeline, along with a full 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/QoRTsPipelineWalkthrough.zip">example dataset</a> with 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/pipelineWalkthrough/bamfiles.zip">example bam files</a>.</p>

<p>For help with individual R functions in the R utility, use the R 
command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(functionname);
</code></pre>

<p>For a full listing of all help topics for the R utility, use the R 
command: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(package="JunctionSeq");
</code></pre>

<h2>INSTALLATION:</h2>

<p>JunctionSeq can be installed automatically in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source("http://hartleys.github.io/JunctionSeq/install/JunctionSeq.install.R");
</code></pre>

<p>In order to successfully install R on windows, you must have Rtools installed.</p>

<p>The splice, gene, and exon read-counts required by JunctionSeq can be created 
using the QoRTs software package, available <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE DATA:</h2>

<p>The example dataset can be found on the github repository and can be 
installed with the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages(JctSeqExData2_0.4.07.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
</code></pre>
